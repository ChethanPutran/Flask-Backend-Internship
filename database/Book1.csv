,,"MY NINE MOST IMPACTFUL MOMENTS OF 2019 1.) when i pulled my hamstring twice and started turning into thanos... then raged my face off in Ibiza for two weeks and made it 10x worse. - 2.) the passing of a young legend. Kong Da Savage was kidnapped & eaten by a coyote. This was the last pic we ever took. He was so soft & so dumb & heâ€™ll always hold a special spot in my heart. If youâ€™re a coyote and youâ€™re reading this, im coming for you ğŸ¹ - 3.) adoption of a new legend, the worldâ€™s greatest looking husky. I try to emulate this dogâ€™s energy. Heâ€™s always happy, ready for adventure, and eager to please. My new best friend. - 4.) when i slapped a man into the 8th dimension & realized i DIDNT want to fly to Russia and enter the International Russian Slapping Contest. May seem obvious but this was a big growth moment for me in realizing that Life > Content. - 5.) When we trolled the entire world & infiltrated the flat earth community under the guise that I, Pogan Laul, believe the earth is flat. Donâ€™t be f**king morons. - 6.) the death of the most iconic bird in history: This little sun conure was my GUY since high school, before Vine. He was eaten by who is currently at Bad Dog Camp. Maverick became a martyr as he continues to emblazon apparel on people across the world. - 7.) extending our family at the Watts Empowerment Center. We brought a Winter Wonderland to kids in California who have never seen snow. I love these hooligans. - 8.) Weâ€™ve been saying it, but the world finally caught up... was awarded â€œPodcast of The Yearâ€ at the 2019 awards. Holy sh*t this show has changed my life & peopleâ€™s perception of me. - 9.) THE FIGHT... after becoming a professional boxer & three months of a grueling fight camp, I unfortunately came up short. Sort of. We sold out the Staples Center, made internet history AGAIN, & became one of the most successful boxing events on Iâ€™ll likely have two fights next year, 1 MMA and 1 Boxing. - Final notes: I didnâ€™t suck that dick (sorry?) Team Maverick is doing 2020 sober 2020 is the year of the girlfriend Two points was bullsh*t "

,,"i hate this post so much and i hate that i have to do this but i believe i owe it to yâ€™all after the years of continuous and relentless support... the iconic has died. After being with me every day for 7 years, since before I even started Vine, Maverick passed while I was away in Sweden. And by passed, I mean, he was eaten by my Mastiff, who mistook him for a small rubber chicken. This little bird inspired so much of what I do, he was my best friend, heâ€™s the inspiration behind the icon worn proudly by millions of people around the world, and as bizarre as it sounds, this little parrotâ€™s legacy will live on FAR beyond his life. Iâ€™m not sure where to go from here or how to handle this because itâ€™s symbolic to me in so many ways, but for all the Mavericks out there who continue to see life through the lens of possibility, who continue to persevere and embrace their differences, I have never-ending love and optimism for you.
